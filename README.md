# Remaking Micrograd
This was a project to ensure I knew the fundamentals of machine learning and gradient descent.
It was based on Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project, as seen here: https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd

The project shows the process of building a Multi-Layer Perceptron from scratch.
